Lewis (@carlvlewis)","tagline":"Journo web-dev., data visualizer, aspiring data scientist","body":"## Hello, world! \r\n#### I'm Carl, and this is the my little open-source corner of the interwebs.\r\n\r\nI'll be keeping a record here of my latest projects in everything from scholarly research, to becoming a d3.js superninja, to pontificating about the complexities of being a white-guilt southerner living and working in New York City. To view almost everything else pertaining to my work (or life), head over to my blog at <http://carlvlew.is>.\r\n\r\n### Why You Should Care\r\nSure, my github is pretty lame right now. I'm new-ish to participating in the open-source realm. (not to cloning, making local changes and deploying, just contributing). My previous employers didn't look kindly upon it. So, almost all of my [pretty awesome past work](http://carlvlewis.net) isn't even online or open-sourced. \r\n\r\n### Not Your Closet-Room Developer\r\nCollaboration isn't just about being a friendly Slack and Github user. It's about working across real-life, off-screen boundaries to achieve a shared goal previously impossible without getting out from behind the screen and dealing with people. Plus, don't we all get CVS (computer vision syndrome) a little when we work too long? I sure do.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
