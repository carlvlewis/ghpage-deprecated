<p>I'll be keeping a record here of my latest projects in everything from scholarly research, to becoming a d3.js superninja, to pontificating about the complexities of being a white-guilt southerner living and working in New York City. To view almost everything else pertaining to my work (or life), head over to my blog at <a href="http://carlvlew.is">http://carlvlew.is</a>.</p>

<p>Sure, my github is pretty lame right now. I'm new-ish to participating in the open-source realm. (not to cloning, making local changes and deploying, just contributing). My previous employers didn't look kindly upon it. So, almost all of my <a href="http://carlvlewis.net">pretty awesome past work</a> isn't even online or open-sourced. </p>

<p>Collaboration isn't just about being a friendly Slack and Github user. It's about working across real-life, off-screen boundaries to achieve a shared goal previously impossible without getting out from behind the screen and dealing with people. Plus, don't we all get CVS (computer vision syndrome) a little when we work too long? I sure do.</p>
